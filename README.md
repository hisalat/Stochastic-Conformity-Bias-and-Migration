## 1. Project Title

Modeling Cultural Transmission with Stochastic Conformity Bias and Migration

## 2. Overview

This repository contains code for simulating the evolution of cultural traits in structured populations under varying conformity bias and migration rates. It builds on Denton & Liberman’s stochastic extension of Boyd & Richerson’s model and integrates a migration component across subpopulations.

## 3. Key Features

Implements stochastic conformity bias (D coefficient varies randomly over time).

Adds migration across multiple subpopulations.

Tracks within- and between-group trait variation.

Includes visualization of population dynamics over time.
